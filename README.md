# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

## Introduction

It is an honor and privilege to be chosen by our client, Louise, to sift through and analyze this set of data related to plethora of different crowdfunding campaigns, exclusively through the platform, Kickstarter. In many instances, one may not know where to begin their journey in pursuing a successful fundraising campaign, but our client took the correct initiative in trusting our company to analyze the overall data, keying in on the important factors that make a campaign successful, as well as spotting trends that will separate Louise from the rest of the pack with her future endeavors.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to allow Louise to create an efficient and successful Kickstarter campaign by bringing to light relevant factors that are of utmost importance when tackling online fundraising as well as identifying key trends and patterns within these factors that will allow her to differentiate and stand out among all other competitors.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

According to our PivotTable and PivotChart created using the outcomes of theater campaigns and launch dates as variables, the conclusion can be made that May is the peak of when these types of fundraisers are started, as 111 were started then. June has a similar data point to May as well at 100. Conversely, May through August and October all had a similar number of failed campaigns, hovering around the 50 mark. Most likely, what this tells us is that Louise should launch her campaign right around May, possibly even June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Noting the line chart created named Outcomes Based on Goal, the less than 1000 and greater than 50000 categories had some polarizing effects on success and failure. In the less than 1000 category, successful campaigns were much more prevalent than failed ones. However, when the goal was greater than 50000, failed campaigns trumped successful ones 87 to 12. From the goal amounts of 20000 to 40000, failed campaigns were the higher statistic. Moreover, the goal ranges of 1-2000 and 35000-45000, successful campaigns were ahead of failed campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge that arose was the need to accept that when taking a look at the relationship between outcomes and goal amounts, we were restricting ourselves to only looking at plays. We could have possibly considered musicals and spaces, but wanted to have a more focused view of the data to give to Louise. Regarding the actual process of creating the analyses, the more challenging part was creating the table showing outcomes based on goals. This involved many varied countif functions, so manual work was a bit at play here.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  - As discussed in the analysis above, successful theater campaigns peaked in May, so this would be the best time to start one. While June is rather high as well, as months pass on, there is a drop in overall campaign launches, except for a spike in October. Therefore, while you should start your campaign in May, you should not keep the duration past 2-3 months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  - Based on the data, except for a pocket between 35000 and 45000, the higher your goal gets, the less likely you are to have a successful campaign. The sweet spot seems to be right in between 1000 and 5000. In this range, there were 388 successful campaigns.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - The dataset did show country of origin, but it would have been nice to show where in the country it was based to gain more information on say if you wanted to know where in the US to have your play. Also, more information on the demographics on the donors of campaigns, if possible, would have been nice to know where to target your marketing efforts if there is enough in the budget for that. Finally, another column of information that could have been relevant was how much was raised in the first 24 hours from the launch date. This piece of information is very indicative of whether the campaign will be a success of failure later down the line. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  - Some other tables that could be created are ones based on the musical and spaces subcategories under the theater parent category to cross-examine them with the play subcategory and see if this is actually what Louise should be focusing on. A graph comparing different countriesâ€™ theater campaigns would also be useful as Louise spoke about interest in the Great Britain. Also showing the success and failure based on average donation would seem to be a useful graph.
